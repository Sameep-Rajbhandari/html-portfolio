    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
        "Hello, I'm Sameep Rajbhandari, a dedicated Motion Graphics 
        Artist with a passion for visual storytelling and design. My 
        educational journey started at Sainik Awashya Mahavidlaya, 
        where I completed my primary education from 2009 to 2014, 
        followed by United Academy for my secondary education from 
        2015 to 2019. I pursued my Bachelor's degree in Information 
        Technology from Islington College during 2017-2019. Currently, 
        I am furthering my education by pursuing an IMBA at Herald College.
    </p>

    <p> 
        My professional journey began as a Motion Graphics Artist at 
        KTM RUSH, where I completed a 3-month internship in 2019, 
        honing my skills in the dynamic world of motion graphics. 
        This experience led me to my first job at Gurkha Tech as a 
        Motion Graphics Artist from 2019 to 2020, where I gained 
        valuable practical insights into the field. Currently, I'm 
        contributing my expertise as a Motion Graphics Artist at 
        Innovate Tech, where I've also worked as an intern trainee, 
        showcasing my dedication to continuous growth.
    </p>

    <p>
        My skill set includes a range of creative and technical tools, 
        including Photoshop, Illustrator, After Effects, and Premiere 
        Pro for crafting visually engaging graphics and animations. 
        Additionally, my proficiency in HTML, JavaScript, and CSS enables 
        me to bring interactive elements to my designs. Alongside my 
        design skills, I am well-versed in Microsoft Office applications, 
        contributing to effective communication and collaboration.
